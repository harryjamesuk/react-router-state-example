Explained tutorial is available [on my Medium post here](https://medium.com/@harryjamesuk/react-state-with-browser-history-223117f6ac61)  

This is a sample application designed to show how you can use state with [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom) *(Using state with the Browser's history)*.
  
We'll be creating an example where we can **swap out a value based on state**. We're currently just updating a `h1` tag based on the state but you could also use this to dynamically swap out a component whilst maintaining DOM history *(You can use the DOM History back/forward/refresh and state will be maintained)*.

_This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to simplify your setup process. Run `npm install` to install dependencies, then `npm start` to view the demo._
